# accordion

This is a simple accordion app. It works well on a tablet, where you can touch multiple keys at once. It's based on some of the accordion layouts I found online. I'll still have to figure out the pitch though.

For now I've left in the fifth notes on the dominant and diminished chords, I might change my mind about that and take them out like on a real accordion. I also might change the sound - right now it's a sawtooth.
